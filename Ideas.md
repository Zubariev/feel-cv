Ideas

CVSense isnt not just another Dashboard business with AI.
We sell confidence and support. 
Understanding the user:

1. Users who are confident in their CVs will not come to us. 
2. The user understands that a job posting is just text, and behind that text are real people, recruiters, and ATS—a program for HR and recruiters.
3. The user understands that a “properly” written CV is the key to success and is willing to invest time and money to achieve this.
4. The user has limited social connections who can evaluate and help write a CV suitable for the job opening.
5. The user is not an expert in psychology, design, and recruiting to understand how a person's (recruiter's) attention works, how color, font, contrast, font size, text block order, etc. work.
6. The user is not sure that there are universal CV templates that suit everyone; that a template that the user likes (for example, in Canva) will also appeal to the recruiter. Moreover, there is a belief that if an experienced recruiter sees and recognizes the template, it will be perceived more negatively by the recruiter.  

Our response to user requests:

1. We understand that job hunting can be stressful and that any change in life can seem like a challenge. That is why we inform users on our landing page that with us, they will have less anxiety about their CVs, and that confidence in understanding and control of the information in their CVs is what users pay a fair price for.
2. We provide technologies that mimic human attention points, proofread CVs down to the last character to ensure they pass through ATS algorithms and are visible to recruiters.
3. We have combined knowledge from the HR industry, psychology, sociology, economics, and modern technologies, including AI, to help achieve the best results. We need user involvement in the analysis process, and we do not charge an exorbitant price for this.  
4. We let users know that they can trust us. Our recommendations work because we are experts in the field. 
5. We inform users that they need to be experts in the field they are applying for, and we take care of everything else. 
6. We convince them that there is no universal recipe for a successful CV. Even a CV created using a template, with our recommendations, can be enhanced so that it works for our user.
