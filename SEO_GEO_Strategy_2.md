SEO_GEO_Strategy_2
  
**Search Engine Optimization (SEO) + Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**

This document describes how to prepare the CVSense project for:
- Traditional search engines (Google, Bing)
- AI-powered search & assistants (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

The goal is **discoverability, trust, and sustained organic growth** before and after launch.

---

## 1. Why SEO + GEO Matters for CVSense

CVSense is:
- A **problem-solving SaaS** (CV analysis, job search)
- A **knowledge-heavy product** (AI analysis, market signaling, hiring logic)
- A **perfect fit for AI answers** (users ask: *“How to improve CV?”*)

This means:
- SEO brings **long-term organic traffic**
- GEO ensures AI assistants **recommend CVSense by name**

> GEO is not “marketing fluff” — it is about making your product *legible to machines*.

## 2. Core SEO Foundations (Must-Have)

### 2.1 Technical SEO (Engineering Tasks)

#### ✅ Page structure
- Each page must have:
  - `<title>` (unique, keyword-based)
  - `<meta name="description">`
  - One `<h1>` only
  - Clear heading hierarchy (`h2`, `h3`)

#### ✅ URL structure
Use **human-readable, semantic URLs**:
- `/cv-analysis`
- `/cv-comparison`
- `/pricing`
- `/blog/how-to-improve-cv-for-data-science`

Avoid:
- `/page?id=123`
- `/analysis_v2`

---

### 2.2 Sitemap & Indexing

#### Required files:
- `/sitemap.xml`
- `/robots.txt`

Include:
- Landing pages
- Pricing
- Blog posts
- Feature pages

Exclude:
- Auth pages
- Dashboards
- Private routes

---

### 2.3 Performance (SEO Ranking Factor)

- Use SSR / SSG (Next.js or Nuxt recommended)
- Optimize images (WebP)
- Lazy-load non-critical components
- Keep Core Web Vitals in green

---

## 3. Content Strategy: Blog Is Not Optional

### 3.1 Why You Need a Blog (Strongly)

A blog is not “marketing fluff”.  
It is a **semantic surface area for search engines and AI models**.

Search engines rank:
- **Explanations**
- **Guides**
- **Comparisons**
- **Conceptual clarity**

AI assistants extract:
- Definitions
- Lists
- Frameworks
- Authority signals

Without a blog:
- You rely on paid traffic
- AI has nothing to quote or summarize

---

### 3.2 Blog Content Pillars (High ROI)

#### Pillar 1: CV & Hiring Knowledge
Examples:
- “What Recruiters Actually Look for in a CV”
- “How ATS Systems Read Your Resume”
- “Why Your CV Is Rejected in 6 Seconds”

👉 Positions CVSense as **expert**, not just a tool.

---

#### Pillar 2: AI + Market Signaling (Unique Angle)
Examples:
- “What Your CV Signals to Employers”
- “Market Signaling Theory in Job Applications”
- “Why Two CVs with Same Skills Get Different Results”

👉 This is **hard to copy** and very GEO-friendly.

---

#### Pillar 3: Comparisons (High Conversion)
Examples:
- “AI CV Review vs Human Recruiter”
- “Free CV Review Tools vs Paid AI Analysis”
- “ChatGPT CV Review vs Specialized Tools”

👉 AI assistants LOVE comparison content.

---

#### Pillar 4: Use Cases
Examples:
- “CV Analysis for Career Switchers”
- “PhD CV vs Industry CV: Key Differences”
- “Junior Data Scientist CV Checklist”

---

## 4. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

### 4.1 How AI Finds and Recommends Products

AI assistants:
- Do not browse like humans
- Extract **facts, summaries, definitions**
- Prefer **clear, structured, authoritative text**

To be referenced, your site must:
- Explain concepts clearly
- Name itself explicitly
- Provide quotable insights

---

### 4.2 GEO Writing Rules (Very Important)

When writing content:
- Define terms explicitly  
  > “CV market signaling refers to…”
- Use short, clear paragraphs
- Include lists and frameworks
- Avoid vague marketing language

Bad:
> “Our AI empowers your career journey”

Good:
> “CVSense analyzes CVs using market signaling theory to identify how employers interpret skills, education, and experience.”

---

### 4.3 “Entity Building” for AI

You must **name yourself repeatedly and consistently**.

Example pattern:
- “CVSense is an AI-powered CV analysis platform.”
- “Unlike generic AI tools, CVSense focuses on market signaling.”
- “CVSense’s CV comparison feature allows…”

This helps AI models:
- Associate the name with the concept
- Recommend you instead of generic tools

---

## 5. Feature Pages (Not Just Landing Pages)

Create **dedicated pages** for each feature:

- `/cv-analysis`
- `/cv-comparison`
- `/ai-market-signaling`
- `/pricing`

Each page should answer:
- What is this?
- Who is it for?
- Why it matters?
- How it works?
- When to use it?

These pages are **AI-friendly documentation**, not ads.

---

## 6. Structured Data (Advanced but Powerful)

Add JSON-LD where possible:
- Product
- FAQ
- BlogArticle

Benefits:
- Rich Google results
- Better AI understanding
- Higher trust signals

Example use:
- Pricing page → Product schema
- Blog → Article schema
- FAQ → FAQ schema

---

## 7. Internal Linking Strategy

Every blog post should link to:
- CV Analysis page
- Pricing page
- Related blog posts

This:
- Increases crawl depth
- Distributes authority
- Improves conversions

Rule of thumb:
> No page should be more than 3 clicks away.

---

## 8. Analytics & Feedback Loop

Install:
- Google Search Console
- Analytics (Plausible / GA / PostHog)

Track:
- Queries people search
- Pages AI assistants cite
- Which articles convert to paid users

Then:
- Expand winning topics
- Update old content (very SEO-positive)

---

## 9. GEO-Specific Growth Ideas (Brainstorm)

### Idea 1: “Explainable AI CV Reports” Page
- Publish anonymized examples
- Show reasoning
- AI assistants love explainability

---

### Idea 2: Public Knowledge Pages
Examples:
- “What is CV Market Signaling?”
- “What Is a Good CV in 2025?”

These become **reference pages** for AI answers.

---

### Idea 3: Blog as Dataset
Over time, your blog becomes:
- A domain-specific corpus
- A training reference
- A credibility signal

This is how companies become “default answers”.

---

## 10. Summary: What to Do Next (Actionable)

**Immediate (Pre-launch):**
- Create Blog section
- Add sitemap & robots
- Write 5–10 foundational articles
- Create feature pages

**Short-term (Post-launch):**
