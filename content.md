All AI-generated content, suggestions, and recommendations provided through the Services are advisory in nature only and are intended to assist Users in creating and improving their CVs and job applications.

2. Bias Mitigation
AI is trained to avoid discrimination based on age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, or other protected characteristics.

Users are encouraged to review AI-generated suggestions and exercise their own judgment when using AI recommendations.

Users acknowledge that AI-generated suggestions and recommendations may not be suitable for all circumstances or job applications, and that Users remain solely responsible for reviewing, editing, and approving all content before submission to potential employers.

3. Transparency
Users are informed when AI tools are being used throughout the CVIVID platform and services.

AI outputs are suggestions, not guarantees. The Company makes no warranties, representations, or guarantees regarding the success of any job application or employment outcome, or the accuracy or suitability of AI-generated content for specific roles or industries.
